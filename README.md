# Sim-Hub-iOS

A simple iOS Webkit wrapper app for SimHub with rotation lock, so when you mount your phone on a steering wheel the screen does not rotate continuously.

There is a small iOS app settings section to enter the default URL of your SimHub server, and the app will automatically try to reload once you switch back from settings. Might look into auto SimHub webserver-discovery at some point if it makes sense. 

The app is currently optimised for older iPhones, might create a more modern Swift version since the iPhone 4s I had lying around wasn't as successful as a device.
